# MalwareDetection
For Kavach Hackathon

Malware analysis tool is a technological solution for the detection and prevention of Fileless Malware. The solution may be in the form of a desktop or mobile application. In recent days, the spread of malware has effectively increased as devices have become more ubiquitous and user places more sensitive data on their devices. The vulnerabilities of the devices  are being exploited by the attackers who got the capability of penetrating into the systems without user authorization causing compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of application and the user.  

The goal is to develop a tool to analyse and detect whether any particular software or data is malware or renign. For this we propose dynamic analysis to reduce damage to devices by detecting both well-known malware and new and variant malware evolved intelligently. Our Malware detection technique uses the convolution neural network (CNN) model. The data set will be processed and generated into image which will be trained in Convolution Neural Network(CNN) and the behaviour images of malware can be classified. Dynamic analysis helps in separating benign applications from malicious ones. At last         the approach will be deployed in a desktop application which can be integrated into systems.
