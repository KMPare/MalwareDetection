# MalwareDetection
For Kavach Hackathon

We propose dynamic analysis for malware detection to reduce damage to devices by detecting both well-known malware and new and variant malware evolved intelligently. Our Malware detection technique uses the convolution neural network (CNN) model and analyzes malware dynamically. 

We perform dynamic analysis on malware to extract behaviors related to memory, network, virtual file system, process, and system call. By converting the extracted and analyzed behavior data into images, the behavior images of malware are classified and trained in the Convolution Neural Network (CNN). 

The approach minimizes the damage of devices from malware by visualizing and learning the vast amount of behavior data generated through dynamic analysis.

Finally the approach will be deployed in a desktop application which can be integrated into systems.

As compared to earlier approaches wherein benign applications were mistaken for malware, this approach helps in differentiating the malware from benign applications.

This makes this approach especially useful  in detecting fileless malwares as they are often the toughest to detect due to their less signatures.

This is possible because in our approach we generate image of the system calls, network packets which in turn is helpful in separating benign applications from malicious ones.

The DAIMD scheme learns IoT malware using the convolution neural network (CNN) model and analyzes IoT malware dynamically in nested cloud environment. DAIMD performs dynamic analysis on IoT malware in a nested cloud environment to extract behaviors related to memory, network, virtual le system, process, and system call. 

The features extracted as signatures of les by DAIMD are memory, network, system call, virtual file system (VFS), and process.

By converting the extracted and analyzed behavior data into images, the behavior images of IoT malware are classied and trained in the Convolution Neural Network (CNN). DAIMD can minimize the infection damage of IoT devices from malware by visualizing and learning the vast amount of behavior data generated through dynamic analysis. 

The DAIMD proposed analyzed behavior features by executing IoT malware using a dynamic analysis technique. Because some IoT malware can easily recognize that they are executed in a limited environment such as a VM, they may avoid malware analysis and detection systems that use the dynamic analysis technique.
